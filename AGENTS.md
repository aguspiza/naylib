# AGENTS.md: AI Collaboration Guide

This document provides essential context for AI models interacting with this project. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and maintain code quality.

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose

* **Primary Goal:** This is a Nim wrapper for raylib, a library for creating 2D and 3D games. The Nim API is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, providing a simplified interface for raylib functions while maintaining cross-platform support.
* **Business Domain:** Game development, multimedia applications, educational tools for programming graphics.

## 2. Core Technologies & Stack

* **Languages:** Nim (version 2.0.0 or higher), C (for the underlying raylib library)
* **Frameworks & Runtimes:** Raylib (C library for game development), GLFW (for window management), OpenGL (for graphics rendering)
* **Key Libraries/Dependencies:** Raylib C source code (bundled), system libraries for graphics/audio (platform-specific)
* **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, Android, macOS, and WebAssembly (via Emscripten).
* **Package Manager:** Nimble

## 3. Architectural Patterns

* **Overall Architecture:** Language binding library that wraps the C raylib library with Nim idioms. Uses a modular approach where different aspects of raylib are exposed through separate modules (raylib.nim, raymath.nim, rlgl.nim, etc.).
* **Directory Structure Philosophy:**
    * `/src`: Contains all primary Nim source code, including the main raylib wrapper and additional modules
    * `/src/raylib`: Contains the bundled C source code for raylib
    * `/src/naylib/private`: Contains configuration options, designed to be used with Nimâ€™s `--define:` compiler flag
    * `/tests`: Contains test files that verify functionality
    * `/docs`: Generated documentation for the Nim API
    * `/tools`: Contains tools for generating the wrapper from the Raylib API definitions
    * `/manual`: Contains detailed documentation guides and overviews
* **Module Organization:** Modules are organized to mirror the raylib library structure with raylib.nim as the core module and additional modules for specific functionality (raymath.nim, rlgl.nim, rcamera.nim, reasings.nim, rmem.nim).

## 4. Coding Conventions & Style Guide

* **Formatting:** Follow Nim's standard style conventions. Use 2-space indentation.
* **Naming Conventions:** 
    * Variables, procedures: camelCase (`screenWidth`, `initWindow`, `drawRectangle`)
    * Types: PascalCase (`Rectangle`, `KeyboardKey`)
    * Constants: PascalCase (`MaxShaderLocations`)
    * Enum values: CamelCase without prefix (`Left`, `Right`, `Middle` for `MouseButton`)
    * Templates/macros: camelCase (`drawing`, `mode3D`)
    * Files: snake_case for Nim files (`raylib.nim`, `raymath.nim`)
* **API Design:** 
    * Provides Nim-idiomatic wrappers around C functions
    * Uses proc overloading instead of suffixes (e.g., `drawRectangle` instead of `drawRectangle`, `drawRectangleV`, etc.)
    * Employs destructors for automatic memory management of raylib types
    * Encapsulates pointers to arrays with index operators for safe access
    * Maps C enums to Nim enums with shortened names (removing prefixes)
    * Abstracts raw pointers with `openArray[T]` and `cstring` with `string`
    * Provides syntactic sugar for begin-end pairs (templates like `drawing`)
    * Introduces `RArray[T]` type for memory-managed arrays
    * Uses `Flags[T]` type for bitflags (e.g., `ConfigFlags`, `Gesture`)
    * Provides alternatives to C functions using standard Nim libraries (e.g., `os.fileExists` instead of `FileExists`)
    * Integrates external data types with `ShaderV` and `Pixel` concepts
    * Offers `WeakImage` and `WeakWave` distinct types for embedded resources
    * Provides operator overloading for vector and matrix types (`+`, `+=`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.)
* **Error Handling:** 
    * Uses Nim's exception system with custom `RaylibError` exceptions for asset loading failures
    * Uses `assert` for precondition checking (e.g., ensuring window is ready before closing)
    * Implements `isValid()` checks in loading functions to prevent unexpected behavior

## 5. Key Files & Entrypoints

* **Configuration:** 
    * `src/naylib/private/config.nim` - Main configuration flags for the library
    * `naylib.nimble` - Package configuration and tasks
    * `update_bindings.nims` - Build and update tasks for the wrapper
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for continuous integration

## 6. Development & Testing Workflow

* **Local Development Environment:** To set up the project locally, you need Nim installed.
    * **Install Nim**
      ```bash
      wget https://codeberg.org/janAkali/grabnim/raw/branch/master/misc/install.sh
      sh install.sh
      grabnim
      ```
    * **Setting up the project**
      1. Run `nimble develop naylib` to clone the repository, this prints Linux installation commands for system dependencies in the output.
      2. Run `nimble check` to verify setup
      3. Run `nimble lock` to generate a package lock file
* **Task Configuration:** 
    * **Nimble Tasks:** Run `nimble tasks` to list all available tasks in the .nimble file, then execute with `nimble <taskname>`
    * **Custom .nims Tasks:** Tasks defined in `update_bindings.nims` can be executed with `nim <taskname> update_bindings.nims`
* **Testing:** Run tests via `nimble test`. Tests are examples that verify basic functionality. New functionality should be accompanied by appropriate tests.
* **CI/CD Process:** GitHub Actions workflow that tests on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS for both native and WebAssembly builds. Also includes a separate CI for Android cross-compilation.

## 7. Specific Instructions for AI Collaboration

* **Contribution Guidelines:**
    * Follow the existing code style and naming conventions
    * Ensure all new functionality is accompanied by appropriate tests
    * Update documentation when making changes to the API
    * Submit pull requests against the `main` branch
* **Security:**
    * Be mindful of security when handling file I/O and external resources
    * Do not hardcode secrets or keys
* **Dependencies:**
    * When adding new dependencies, edit the .nimble file and run `nimble lock`
    * Core raylib is bundled, so updates require running the update task in `update_bindings.nims`
* **Commit Messages:** Follow conventional commit messages with clear, descriptive summaries of changes
